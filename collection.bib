It may seem that DES is insecure and no longer of any use, but that is not the case since the DES and 3DES algorithms are still beyond the capability of most attacks in the present day. However, the power of computers is increasing and stronger algorithms are required to face hacker attacks. AES has been designed in software and hardware and it works quickly and efficiently, even on small devices such as smart phones. With a large block size and a longer keys, AES will provide more security in the long term.},

abstract = {In today's internet era, with online transactions almost every second and terabytes of data being generated everyday on the internet, securing information is a challenge. Cryptography is an integral part of modern world information security making the virtual world a safer place. Cryptography is a process of making information unintelligible to an unauthorized person. Hence, providing confidentiality to genuine users. There are various cryptographic algorithms that can be used. Ideally, a user needs a cryptographic algorithm which is of low cost and high performance. However, in reality such algorithm which is a one stop solution does not exist. There are several algorithms with a cost performance trade off. For example, a banking application requires utmost security at high cost and a gaming application sending player pattern for analytics does not bother much about security but needs to be fast and cost effective. Thus, amongst the cryptographic algorithms existing, we choose an algorithm which best fits the user requirements. In, this process of choosing cryptographic algorithms, a study of strengths, weakness, cost and performance of each algorithm will provide valuable insights. In our paper, we have implemented and analyzed in detail cost and performance of popularly used cryptographic algorithms DES, 3DES, AES, RSA and blowfish to show an overall performance analysis, unlike only theoretical comparisons.},

abstract = {Now days, Data security is very challenging issue that touches many areas including computers and communication. Recently, we came across many attacks on cyber security that have played with the confidentiality of the users. These attacks just broke all the security algorithms and affected the confidentiality, authentication, integrity, availability and identification of user data. Cryptography is one such way to make sure that confidentiality, authentication, integrity, availability and identification of user data can be maintained as well as security and privacy of data can be provided to the user. Encryption is the process of converting normal data or plaintext to something incomprehensible or cipher-text by applying mathematical transformations or formulae. These mathematical transformations or formulae used for encryption processes are called algorithms. We have analysed ten data encryption algorithms DES, Triple DES, RSA, AES, ECC, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH, RC5 and IDEA etc. Among them DES, Triple DES, AES, RC5, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH and IDEA are symmetric key cryptographic algorithms. RSA and ECC are asymmetric key cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we have analysed various encryption algorithms on the basis of different parameters and compared them to choose the best data encryption algorithm so that we can use it in our future work.},

In the pro- posed algorithm two dimensional chaotic map and the two secrets keys for encryption of image are used in which first we divide the image into four blocks and then each block of the image is encrypted individually in n times, after that the keys are inverted for each block and repeat this process up to m times.

Having compared with some other researches in terms of structure of the processor, speed and latency, we develop ultrahigh speed architectures for a reformulated version of AES algorithm, which shows a greater superiority than other ones currently. The merit comes that: Firstly, the processor is able to process 128 bits data during each clock period, only bringing 10 clock periods latency and saving 4K storage space. Secondly, we used a same and symmetric pipelining structure but different connection order and stored different initial keys in inner register when designing decryption module. Thus, the processor seems to be an asymmetrical system. Thirdly, the method that data involved in multiplication in Galois field was stored in ROM is used as the key to guarantee the safety of data and prohibit tampering.},

In this paper, the symmetric key standard for encryption and decoding is propelled Encryption standard (AES). The key stride in the AES is the "S-Box". S Box is an imperative segment for symmetric key calculations. An S- box takes some number of information bits "p" and interprets them in yield bits 'q', where "p" is not as a matter of course equivalent to 'q'. In AES Encryption calculation Sub Bytes change uses S-Box and Inverse S-Box uses Inverse of S-Box. The Sub Bytes substitution is a nonlinear byte substitution that uses substitution table (i.e., S-Box) takes the multiplicative reverse (GF (28)) and infers a relative change to do the Sub Bytes change. Though, converse Sub Bytes Substitution additionally uses gaze upward table (i.e., Reverse S-Box) takes an opposite relative change and after that suggests multiplicative backwards of Galois Field (GF (28)). In this printed material, we investigated substitution table/reverse substitution table, multiplicative opposite and relative change and its converse (i.e. reverse relative change) science in Galois field. A standout amongst the most basic issues in AES is the force utilization. Here, we predominantly centered around the force utilization and in addition security of S-box which is the most power devouring square in the AES. We have executed and reproduced S-Box and Inverse S-Box Lookup table and acquired another improved scrambled Lookup table for more upgraded mystery by utilizing Xilinx Spartan-3 assessment board.

Namun seiring dengan kemajuan teknologi, terdapat dampak negatif berupa penyadapan data sehingga aspek keamanan dalam pertukaran informai dianggap penting.

Kriptografi merupakan salah satu solusi atau metode pengamanan data yang tepat untuk menjaga kerahasiaan dan keaslian data, serta dapat meningkatkan aspek keamanan suatu data atau informasi. Metode ini bertujuan agar informasi yang bersifat rahasia dan dikirim melalui suatu jaringan, seperti LAN atau Internet, tidak dapat diketahui atau dimanfaatkan oleh orang atau pihak yang tidak berkepentingan. Kriptografi mendukung kebutuhan dua aspek keamanan informasi, yaitu perlindungan terhadap kerahasiaan data informasi dan perlindungan terhadap pemalsuan dan pengubahan informasi yang tidak diinginkan. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa algoritma AES dengan panjang kunci 256 bit dapat menyandikan isi suatu file sehingga dapat mengamankan file tersebut.

Hence, framework required to provide the security with minimum computational overhead. We develop the scheme to secure the mobile data in cloud using cryptography, in which Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Blowfish algorithm are integrated to provide authentication and confidentiality. To transmit the data more securely, random number is used to increase computational complexity for an adversary. We also randomize the number of rounds of Blowfish for performance improvement. Our approach is implemented and tested with different platforms like personal computer, android emulator, smartphone and aakash tablet.},

abstract = {Mobile security or mobile phone security has become increasingly important in mobile computing. It is of particular concern as it relates to the security of personal information now stored on smart phones. More and more users and businesses use smart phones as communication tools but also as a means of planning and organizing their work and private life. Within companies, these technologies are causing profound changes in the organization of information systems and therefore they have become the source of new risks. Indeed, smart phones collect and compile an increasing amount of sensitive information to which access must be controlled to protect the privacy of the user and the intellectual property of the company. All smart phones, as computers, are preferred targets of attacks. These attacks exploit weaknesses related to smart phones that can come from means of communication like SMS, MMS, wifi networks, and GSM. There are also attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities from both the web browser and operating system. Finally, there are forms of malicious software that rely on the weak knowledge of average users. Different security counter-measures are being developed and applied to smart phones, from security in different layers of software to the dissemination of information to end users. There are good practices to be observed at all levels, from design to use, through the development of operating systems, software layers, and downloadable apps.},

User purchase and pay more with their mobile device than desktop. Therefore, the security of M-commerce transaction should be strong enough to enhance its performance. Mobile phones use WAP, i-mode and J2ME technologies for programming for making transaction. The data during transaction is sent as XML file. The XML processor takes more time to encrypt which leads to breakdown the security during transaction. This paper has defined the code to parse XML file which reduces it size so that data during transaction would be sent with ease and fast. The code is written in XML and J2ME as these technologies can easily run on multiple platform.},

Encryption algorithm plays an important role for information security guarantee. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of two symmetric key encryption algorithms: DES and Blowfish which commonly used for network data encryption. In this paper, we analyzed encryption security, evaluated encryption speed and power consumption for both algorithms. Experimental results show that Blowfish algorithm runs faster than DES, while the power consumption is almost the same. It is proved that the Blowfish encryption algorithm maybe more suitable for wireless network application security.},

Only those who possess a secret key can decipher (or decrypt) the message into plain text. Encrypted information can sometimes be broken by cryptanalysis, also called code breaking, although modern cryptography techniques are virtually unbreakable. Various algorithms help achieve flawless encryption results which are mostly unbreakable. This paper is an attempt to improve one such algorithm, i.e. RC6 by adding on to its existing functionalities.},
